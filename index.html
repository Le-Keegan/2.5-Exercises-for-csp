      <h2>About me</h2>
      <h3>hobbies</h3>
      <p>I like to ride dirtbikes. I used to go up to walker valley with my uncle until his dad died after that, we stopped going altogether. Another hobby of mine is driving RC cars until they crash then there's not much fun in it. I also like to build models, I wish I could show my uncle, my models, I can't since he passed away in February.</p>
      <h3>What my name means</h3>
      <p>My first name means son of eden, middle: lover of earth, and my last name isn't school appropriate.</p>
